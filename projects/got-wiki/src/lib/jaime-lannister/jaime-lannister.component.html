      Ser Jaime Lannister, commonly known as the "Kingslayer", was the elder son of Lord Tywin Lannister, younger twin brother of Cersei Lannister, and older brother of Tyrion Lannister. He was involved in an incestuous relationship with Cersei, and unknown to most, he was the biological father of her three bastard children, Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.
